# AI Assistant Files

This directory contains instructions and guidelines for AI assistants working on the Martnex project.

## Files

### [instructions.md](instructions.md)
Comprehensive guidelines for AI assistants including:
- Project overview and principles
- Technical guidelines and standards
- Code patterns and best practices
- Common tasks and workflows
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation standards
- Git workflow
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Use this for:** Detailed guidance on implementing features, architectural decisions, and understanding project conventions.

### [quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)
Quick lookup reference with:
- Tech stack summary
- Common commands
- File patterns
- Code style examples
- Key features overview
- Port numbers
- Important rules

**Use this for:** Quick lookups during development, checking syntax, finding the right pattern.

## Purpose

These files help AI assistants:
1. **Understand the project** - Tech stack, architecture, business logic
2. **Follow conventions** - Code style, file organization, naming
3. **Make informed decisions** - When to ask vs proceed autonomously
4. **Maintain quality** - Security, performance, testing standards
5. **Be productive** - Common patterns, quick references, troubleshooting

## For Developers

When working with AI assistants on this project:
- Point them to these files at the start of a session
- Update these files when conventions change
- Add new patterns as the codebase evolves
- Keep guidelines practical and example-driven

## For AI Assistants

1. **Read instructions.md first** - Understand the full context
2. **Use quick-reference.md often** - Quick lookups during coding
3. **Follow the patterns** - Consistency is key
4. **Ask when uncertain** - Especially for architecture decisions
5. **Update docs** - When you add new patterns or conventions

## Version History

- **v1.0** (2024-11-26) - Initial AI instructions and quick reference
